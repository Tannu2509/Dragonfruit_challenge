    "Reason: Since the microscope images are binary (black for the parasite blob, white for the background), RLE is an efficient way to compress the image. RLE stores consecutive pixels of the same color as a single value and a count, which is highly effective for binary images with large contiguous regions.\n",

However, for realistic images with large contiguous regions, the storage would be significantly smaller, likely in the range of 1-10 GB.\n",

A sparse matrix representation stores only the coordinates of the pixels where the dye is present, ignoring the white background. Since the dye is expected to be present in less than 10% of the parasite's body (and even less in the surrounding area), a sparse matrix is ideal for storing only the relevant pixels.\n",
